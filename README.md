# IGdm Messenger
Multi-platform Desktop application for INSTAGRAM DMs, built with electron

### It's a fork! üç¥
This is a **modified** version of Caprine that includes updated dependencies and other fixes. This enables Caprine to:
1) Run on newer OSs that use the clone3 syscall (e.g. Arch Linux, Fedora Rawhide, Ubuntu 22.04, etc.) (#1790)
2) Run on newer hardware (Apple Silicon / M1) (#1772)
3) Be more secure, as a lot of vulnerabilities were patched

Its sole purpose is to provide people with a more secure & up to date client until those issues can be fixed upstream.
